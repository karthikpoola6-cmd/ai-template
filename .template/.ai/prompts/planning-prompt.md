I want to {YOUR_GOAL_HERE}

I'm continuing from a previous session. Please read:
{CHECKPOINT_PATH}

Summarize what was accomplished and what's left to do.

Before we start coding, let's plan this session:

1. What files will we need to create/modify?
2. What are the key components/functions?
3. What dependencies or external services do we need?
4. What tests should we write?
5. Can we complete this in one session (within context window)?
6. Does this align with our architecture?

Once we have a solid plan that fits in one session, I'll ask you to proceed.
